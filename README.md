# üß† FoundrScore

**FoundrScore** is an AI-powered web app that predicts the likelihood of a startup's success based on historical data.  
It uses a trained machine learning model to analyze key startup features and outputs a probability score ‚Äî your "FoundrScore."

---

## Features

- Predict startup success based on location, funding history, and category
- Trained with a Random Forest classifier + GridSearchCV tuning
- Flask web app with interactive input form
- Built-in ML model for real-time predictions

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible thanks to the dataset:

Big Startup Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase
Published by @yanmaksi on Kaggle

The dataset compiles startup company data from Crunchbase, including funding history, location, categories, and outcomes.
It provided the foundation for training and evaluating the FoundrScore prediction model.
